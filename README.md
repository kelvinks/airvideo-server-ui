While I make every effort to deliver a high quality product, we do not guarantee that our products are free from defects. This software is provided â€œas is," and you use the software at your own risk.

This software isn't supported by Inmethod. Any sofware fault is probably my own.

## Installation

Open a Terminal and type:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rubiojr/airvideo
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install airvideo-server

## Notes

AirVideo Server properties file is stored by default in ~/.config/airvideo-server. Settings are managed with the AirVideo Server panel indicator.

The airvideo-server script is intended to be used from the command line an reads ~/.config/airvideo-server/server.properties by default or /opt/airvideo-server/AirVideoServerLinux.properties when the user config file isn't found.
